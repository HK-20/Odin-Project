    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Â½ cups basmati rice </li>
        <li> 8 whole cloves</li>
        <li> 4 black cardamom pod </li>
        <li> 4 cinnamon sticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> ordered list</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step </strong><br> Place the basmati rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 30 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li><strong>step</strong><br> Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir the garlic paste and ginger paste into the onion mixture; cook until the garlic and ginger is fragrant, about 1 minute more. Sprinkle the cilantro and mint over the mixture and cook 1 minute more. </li>
        <li><strong>step</strong><br> Add the lamb chops to the skillet; season with salt. Cook and stir the lamb until the meat begins to brown, about 20 minutes. </li>
        <li><strong>step</strong><br> Stir the tomatoes, green chile peppers, and ground red pepper into the mixture; continue cooking until the oil begins to separate from the gravy, about 10 minutes. Add the yogurt and lemon juice; cover and cook until the lamb is tender, about 15 minutes. Add water as needed to keep the mixture from getting too dry. </li>
        <li><strong>step</strong><br> Bring the rice, 7 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan until the rice is nearly done yet a little chewy, 10 to 15 minutes; drain any excess water. </li>
        <li><strong>step</strong><br> Layer about half the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid. Spoon the lamb masala over the rice. Spread the fried onion over the lamb masala. Top with the remaining rice. Stir the saffron and warm milk together in a small bowl; pour over the top layer of rice. Cover the pot with the lid and place the pot over low heat; cook until the rice is thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
